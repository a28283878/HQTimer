# HQTimer
HQTimer: a Hybrid Q-learning based Timeout Mechanism in Software-Defined Networks

Source code for [1].

Need dpkt package to run traffic.py. Need Keras package to run predict.py.

Sample traffic file (sample.pcap) is provided. Real trace used in the experiments could be found in [2]. Sample policy file and corresponding trace file (test_rule and test_rule_trace) generated by ClassBench [3] are provided.

pcap:
1. pre_traffic.pre_pcap 使用pcap產生pkl(trace log)
2. pre_traffic.pre_single 使用pkl(trace log)產生使用在single topo的pkl(trace log)
3. pre_traffic.pre_rule 使用pkl(single topo trace log)產生pkl(single topo ruleset)，並且會產生不同比例的wildcard ruleset數量
