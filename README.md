# HQTimer
HQTimer: a Hybrid Q-learning based Timeout Mechanism in Software-Defined Networks

Source code for [1].

Need dpkt package to run traffic.py. Need Keras package to run predict.py.

Sample traffic file (sample.pcap) is provided. Real trace used in the experiments could be found in [2]. Sample policy file and corresponding trace file (test_rule and test_rule_trace) generated by ClassBench [3] are provided.
